# Lexer-Compilers-Team2
Repo for the Lexer of Compliers subject (School of Engineering, 2025-2 semester)

## Introduction
#### Problem statement.
> Create a lexical analyzer using the concepts learned in the theoretical sessions, capable of identifying the basic lexical elements (tokens) and classifying them according to the type of token they belong to.

#### Motivation.
> The creation of our lexical analyzer is a fundamental step, as it allows us to convert the input text into tokens and classify them into predefined categories, making it easier for the compiler to interpret them. Since lexical analysis is the first phase in the process of building a compiler, understanding how it works will provide us with the necessary foundation to develop the subsequent stages, enabling us to progress towards the complete creation of our compiler.

#### Objectives.
> Develop an initial idea of a Context-Free Grammar (CFG) that applies right recursion and left factoring, with the purpose of creating a lexical analyzer capable of identifying and classifying the different types of tokens present in a text string.

## Theoretical framework 
Lexical Analyzer: A lexical analyzer is a program that converts the input text into tokens and classifies these tokens into predefined categories. The lexical analyzer plays a crucial role in the analysis phase, as it provides the tokens to the parser to facilitate syntax analysis.

Token: A token is a sequence of characters grouped into a single entity. Each token represents a set of character sequences that convey a specific meaning.
Classification:
Constants
* Keywords
* Identifiers
* Literals
* Operators
* Punctuation
* Special characters
